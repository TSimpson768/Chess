# Chess

The final project for the Ruby part of The Odin Project! The game is now working and implements all of the rules of chess.

My main takeaway from this is just how important good testing is. I've lost count on how many times I've had to update a test after a change, or I encountered a bug when playtesting which did not show up in my test suite.

Also - modularize your code! I was able to take my saves module from my hangman project and use it here after converting it to YAML.

If anyone reading this finds a bug - please let me know!
